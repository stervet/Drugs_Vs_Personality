## Overview
This project aims at examining the relationship between personality traits and drug consumption based on the Drug consumption (quantified) Data Set. The Dataset contains 35 variables of 1885 people.. First, the normalized data is coded into more apprehensible, numeric categories. Then further features are engineered to highlight deeper data structures. The engineered variables are: soft drug consumption, hard drug consumption, legal drug consumption, illegal drug consumption, synthetic and nonsynthetic drug consumption, recent consumtion, hard score and hardliners.

The hard score (hard_score) is build of the mean of neuroticism, extraversion, impulsiveness and sensation seeking. The hardliner variable, however, comprises only the 10% highest hard scores. Business Case

A drug prevention organization is interested in the use frequency of illegal drugs of hardliner personalities versus other people. Furthermore, they want to predict the use of illegal drugs.

The project was part of a data science bootcamp and should cover all stages of the data science cycle:

## Data Science Lifecycle
* 1 Business Understanding
* 2 Data Mining
* 3 Data Cleaning
* 4 Data Exploration
* 5 Feature Engineering
* 6 Predictive Modeling
* 7 Data Visualization
Python Modules used:
Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly / sklearn

## Used ML Models
Models were applied and compared for recall and accuracy scores

XGBClassifier
AdaBoost
RandomForestClassifier
Support Vector Machine
DecisionTreeClassifier
Conclusions
reliable prediction of hardliners is not possible with current data
reliable prediction of illegal drug users on the other hand is possible based on: sensation seeking, ethnicity, openness to new experiences, country, conscientiousness, age
illegal drug use is a widespread issue throughout society
Future Work
Data related implications:

collect data on socioeconomic status
collect data on amount of drug doses
collect data on clinical diagnoses
collect data on abuse and addiction
collect timeline data to identify co-morbidity of diverse substance abuse or/and addiction
Model related implications:

try unsupervised machine learning models
apply regression models on continuous data
new model for hardliner prediction
